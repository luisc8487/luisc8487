**`Fullstack Developer and Data Engineer`**

As a fellow at Marcy Lab School, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that can benefit people's lives. With my background in data engineering and an eagerness to learn new technologies to develop better full-stack applications, I strive to combine these two fields to produce exceptional products that can bring positive change to the world.

My experience in data engineering has taught me to always question both sides of your objective and construct a plan where data has a relationship with other data sets. Once everything is planned out, execute those data sets with a structure query language in order to neatly place each data set in its respected location. With the proper structure set in place, we can deliver a faster response time without wasting extra space.

I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals, so feel free to reach out to me. Let's create something amazing together!
